* Search for: `'_s'` and replace with: `'megatherium'`
* Search for: `_s_` and replace with: `megatherium_`

* Search for: <code>&nbsp;_s</code> and replace with: <code>&nbsp;Megatherium</code>
* Search for: `_s-` and replace with: `megatherium-`


1. Search for `'_s'` (inside single quotations) to capture the text domain.
2. Search for `_s_` to capture all the function names.
3. Search for `Text Domain: _s` in style.css.
4. Search for <code>&nbsp;_s</code> (with a space before it) to capture DocBlocks.
5. Search for `_s-` to capture prefixed handles.

Then, update the stylesheet header in style.css and the links in footer.php with your own information. Next, update or delete this readme.

Now you're ready to go! The next step is easy to say, but harder to do: make an awesome WordPress theme. :)

Good luck!
